## Focus Areas

Our initial effort is initially focussed on three areas
- Attestation - Giving Application Owner confidence their workload (containers) are really running in a TEE and it 
guarantees the initial state of the TEE (for initial effort this includes the kata-agent).
- OCI Container Image Pull - Ensuring the Container Images cannot be viewed or altered before they are started and available within the TEE.
- Restricting Orchestration Capabilities accepted today but which undermine Confidential Containers.

We will continue to engage more widely with CNCF projects around kubelet, container runtimes and seek to address further 
integration topics regarding confidential computing such as
- CSI plugins
- CNI 
- Align confidential Computing with Expected User Experience
- Tooling enhancements to facilitate Confidential Computing
- Align confidential computing with broader Security considerations within CNCF
- Confidential Computing thinking from other projects
